If receiving the following message and errors downloading packages when running go fetch with nuget on Linux:

WARNING: Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure

The solution is to run the following command:
mozroots --import --ask-remove 

Which adds some missing ssl certs to mono's certificate store.
